# Cardiovascular_Disease: Causes, Treatment, and Prevention
In this project, I conducted an in-depth investigation into one of the leading causes of death worldwide: cardiovascular disease. Drawing from decades of medical research, I explored multiple causes and effects across four distinct studies to gain comprehensive insights into this critical health issue.

## Part 1: Causes of Death
To establish a historical perspective, I delved into the major causes of death over the past century (1900 to 2015). By analyzing extensive data, I identified trends, patterns, and shifts in the prevalence of different causes, shedding light on the evolving landscape of mortality.

## Part 2: The Framingham Heart Study
In this section, I focused on the renowned Framingham Heart Study, an observational investigation into cardiovascular health. By applying A/B testing methodologies and simulations of the test statistic, I examined the collected data to uncover significant insights regarding cardiovascular risk factors and their impact on overall health outcomes.

## Part 3: Hormone Replacement Therapy for Cardiovascular Health
Building upon the previous sections, I explored the relationship between hormone replacement therapy and the risk of coronary heart disease in post-menopausal women. Leveraging data from the Nurses' Heart Study and the Heart and Estrogen-Progestin Replacement Study, I employed bootstrapping techniques and hypothesis testing to assess the effectiveness of hormone replacement therapy in reducing cardiovascular risk.

## Part 4: Effect of Saturated Fat Consumption on Cardiovascular Death Rates
In the final section, I focused on the impact of saturated fat consumption on cardiovascular mortality rates. Using data from the National Heart-Diet Study, I conducted hypothesis tests to evaluate the association between saturated fat intake and cardiovascular health outcomes, providing valuable insights into dietary recommendations for reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease.

Through this comprehensive analysis, I aimed to deepen our understanding of cardiovascular disease and its various contributing factors. By examining extensive datasets and employing rigorous statistical methods, this project offers valuable insights into prevention, treatment, and overall cardiovascular health.
